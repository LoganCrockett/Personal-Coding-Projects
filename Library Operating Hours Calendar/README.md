# Project Name: Library Operating Hours Calendar
# Purpose:
This calendar was created for the Etowah Carnegie Library to use on their website. It will obtain the day of the week and highlight the appropriate table row showing what the hours are for that day. It was designed to be a pre-formatted table and embedded into their website. It can be found <a href="https://www.etowahlibrary.com/">here</a>.
**Note:** It may take a while to load on their web page. There is a lot of content on that page that has to load.
# How to Run
To run it on your local machine, just download all three files and stick them in the same folder. Then, open the **calendar.html** file in your browser and it should work.
